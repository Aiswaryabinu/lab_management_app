Project Description

The Coding Lab Management System is an innovative web platform designed to revolutionize coding education. It empowers students to write, compile, and submit code seamlessly while providing educators with advanced tools to manage assignments, evaluate submissions, and uphold academic collaboration.

The Problem Statement

Managing coding labs in educational institutions is inefficient due to the lack of a centralized system for assigning coding problems, compiling and submitting code, tracking student progress and tracking of student progress by the educators.

The Solution

We developed a Coding Lab Management System to streamline lab-based programming education by enabling teachers to create and manage assignments, students to write and submit code with real-time compilation, and providing a centralized platform for both teacher and student convenience.
